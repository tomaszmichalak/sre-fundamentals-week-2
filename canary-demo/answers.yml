# Rollback Test
rollback_test:
  previous_revision: #TODO: Enter the revision number before rollback
  rollback_command_used: helm rollback canary-demo 1 -n canary-demo
  time_to_rollback_seconds: 1 # I built the image locally, so the rollback was very fast

# Error Budget Calculation (based on 99.9% SLO)
error_budget:
  monthly_error_budget_seconds: 2592.00
  remaining_error_budget_percentage: 100.00%

# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: 
    - docker image v3 is not pulling, I had to build it locally first
  suggested_improvements: 
    - use nip.io for DNS resolution, it's a great tool for testing and no /etc/hosts file changes are needed
    - use kind instead of minikube for local testing, it's faster and more reliable - and it is easier to reset the cluster
    - use helm rollback --wait to ensure the rollback is complete before running the next command
